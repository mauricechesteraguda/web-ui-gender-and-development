# Gender and Development AI-Assisted Survey and Reporting System (Web UI Prototype)

## Overview

This repository contains a **web UI prototype** of a system designed to revolutionize survey collection and reporting on gender and development issues. The prototype simulates the user interface and workflow of the final application, which leverages AI-assisted inputs to streamline the creation of budget plans and accomplishment reports, ensuring data accuracy and insightful analysis.

Although this is only a front-end prototype, it demonstrates how the final system will enhance decision-making, improve resource allocation, and support comprehensive reporting, thereby boosting the efficiency and effectiveness of gender and development initiatives.

## Key Features (Prototype)

- **Simulated Survey Collection**: Demonstrates how users will interact with a simplified survey collection interface focused on gender and development issues.
  
- **Prototype Budget Plan Creation**: Showcases the design and flow for generating budget plans for gender and development projects.

- **Simulated Accomplishment Reports**: Presents the interface for creating and managing reports to track project progress.

- **UI/UX Design**: Focuses on providing an intuitive, user-friendly interface that will eventually be integrated with back-end AI tools.

- **Responsive Design**: The prototype is built using **Bootstrap** for a mobile-first, responsive experience, ensuring accessibility on various devices.

## Purpose

This web UI prototype serves as a simulation of the final system's design and workflow. It is **not yet connected** to the back-end AI algorithms and database, but it provides a visual and interactive representation of how the real system will function.

## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and mobile-first design.
- **jQuery**: For enhancing interactivity and DOM manipulation.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the structure and styling of the web UI.

## Installation and Simulation

To view and simulate this prototype locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to simulate the app:
    - On macOS:
      ```bash
      open index.html
      ```
    - On Windows:
      Simply double-click the `index.html` file.

4. **Note**: This is a front-end prototype, so no back-end functionality (AI, database, etc.) is present.

## Future Development

The full system will include:

- **AI-Driven Insights**: Integration with machine learning models for real-time data analysis.
- **Database Connectivity**: For persistent data storage and management.
- **Advanced Reporting and Visualization**: To generate in-depth reports with graphical insights.
